For representation in the computer, the (partial) image is sampled in x direction with 20 sampling points per mm and in y direction with 10 sampling points per mm.\n\n\nWhat is the theoretical maximum value of \\(f_{umax}\\) and \\(f_{vmax}\\) if error-free image reconstruction from the digital image should be possible (not using any compressive-sensing techniques)? (6pts)\n\n\n\nAccording to the Nyquist sampling theorem, the maximum representable frequency (Nyquist frequency) in each direction is half the sampling frequency. The sampling frequency can be derived from the given sampling points per mm.\n\nSampling frequency in x: \\(f_{sx} = 20\\;\\text{points/mm} = 20 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{points/m}\\)\nNyquist frequency in x: \\(f_{Nx} = \\frac{f_{sx}}{2} = 10.0 \\, \\text{kHz}\\)\nSampling frequency in y: \\(f_{sy} = 10 \\, \\text{points/mm} = 10 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{points/m}\\)\nNyquist frequency in y: \\(f_{Ny} = \\frac{f_{sy}}{2} = 5.0 \\, \\text{kHz}\\)\n\n\nSpatial Frequency Range: The Fourier transform results in a spatial frequency representation, where \\(f_{umax}\\) and \\(f_{vmax}\\) are bounded by the Nyquist frequencies:\n\\[\nf_{umax} = 10 \\, \\text{kHz}, \\quad f_{vmax} = 5 \\, \\text{kHz}\n\\]\nImplications for Computation:\n\nThe resulting Fourier transform $ F(u, v) $ will have a spectrum limited by these frequencies.\nFrequencies higher than $ f_{umax} $ in $ u $ or $ f_{vmax} $ in $ v $ cannot be represented due to aliasing.\nProper anti-aliasing filtering before sampling ensures the signal’s frequency content does not exceed these bounds.\n\n\nWould you like further clarification or help with visualization?"
